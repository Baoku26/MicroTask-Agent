## Phase 1 — Smart Contract (Days 1–3)

### Day 1 — Write & test contract locally

- [x] Create `contracts/` directory and initialize Hardhat project
- [x] Install dependencies: `hardhat`, `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox`
- [x] Write `MicroTaskPayment.sol`
  - [x] Define task type constants (CAPTION=1, EMAIL=2, SUMMARY=3, EXPLAIN=4, IMAGE=5, TRANSLATE=6)
  - [x] Set up `taskPrices` mapping with initial values
  - [x] Implement `requestTask(uint8 taskType)` — transferFrom + event emit
  - [x] Implement `withdraw()` with `onlyOwner`
  - [x] Implement `updatePrice()` with `onlyOwner`
  - [x] Implement `getPrice()` public view
  - [x] Define `TaskRequested` event with all indexed fields
- [x] Write `contracts/scripts/deploy.ts`
- [x] Configure `hardhat.config.js` for Alfajores + Celo Mainnet
- [x] Run `npx hardhat compile` — zero errors

### Day 2 — Contract testing (local) + prep for mainnet

> NOTE: Alfajores forno RPC (alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org) is NXDOMAIN — decommissioned by Celo.
> No public Alfajores RPC found. Replaced testnet deploy with thorough local Hardhat tests.

- [x] Write `test/MicroTaskPayment.test.js` — 16 tests covering all contract functions
- [x] All 16 tests passing locally (npm test)
  - [x] cUSD `approve()` + `requestTask()` flow verified
  - [x] `TaskRequested` event fields verified (user, taskType, amount, requestId, timestamp)
  - [x] cUSD balance transfer verified
  - [x] `withdraw()` owner flow verified
  - [x] `withdraw()` non-owner revert verified
  - [x] `updatePrice()` owner + non-owner verified
  - [x] Unique requestId per call verified
- [x] `tsconfig.json` added (module: commonjs, ignoreDeprecations: 6.0)
- [x] `contracts/test/MockERC20.sol` added for local test fixture
- [ ] Add `PRIVATE_KEY` and `CELOSCAN_API_KEY` to `.env.local` before mainnet deploy

### Day 3 — Mainnet deploy & verify

- [x] Review contract one final time before mainnet
- [x] Deploy to Celo Mainnet: `npm run deploy:mainnet`
- [x] Contract deployed: `0x986C4960276545B9672a0621511FC9D4b7e88912`
- [x] Record mainnet contract address in:
  - [x] `planning.md`
  - [x] `CLAUDE.md`
  - [x] `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
- [x] Verify on Celoscan — source verified ✓
- [x] Confirm contract publicly visible: https://celoscan.io/address/0x986C4960276545B9672a0621511FC9D4b7e88912#code

---

## Phase 2 — Frontend Scaffold (Days 4–5)

- [x] Install Tailwind CSS v4 + postcss + autoprefixer + @tailwindcss/postcss
- [x] `styles/globals.css` — all 10 CSS variables + Tailwind v4 @theme tokens + skeleton shimmer
- [x] `lib/constants.ts` — task types, prices, labels, descriptions, chain config
- [x] `lib/wagmi.ts` — wagmiConfig with Celo chain + forno RPC
- [x] `app/providers.tsx` — WagmiProvider + RainbowKitProvider + QueryClientProvider
- [x] `app/layout.tsx` — Space Mono + DM Sans fonts, metadata, providers wired
- [x] `app/page.tsx` — scaffold shell (full UI Day 11)
- [x] `next.config.js` + `postcss.config.js` created
- [x] `tsconfig.json` updated for Next.js; `tsconfig.hardhat.json` split out for Hardhat
- [x] `package.json` — dev/build/start/type-check scripts added
- [x] Dev server boots clean on localhost:3000 ✓

### Day 5 — Routing & page shells

- [x] `app/page.tsx` — home with staggered TaskCard grid (4 V1 tasks + coming-soon strip)
- [x] `app/task/[type]/page.tsx` — dynamic route, validates task ID, shows skeleton input + disabled pay button
- [x] `app/not-found.tsx` — 404 page for invalid routes
- [x] `components/TaskCard.tsx` — price badge, hover glow, Framer Motion stagger entrance
- [x] `components/ResultCard.tsx` — result display, copy button, Celoscan tx link, reset CTA
- [x] All routes verified: / → 200, /task/1 → 200, /task/99 → 404 ✓
- [x] Fixed: WalletConnect projectId fallback, viewport metadata, webpack missing-module warnings

---

## Phase 3 — Wallet Integration (Days 6–7)

### Day 6 — MiniPay detection + connect

- [x] `hooks/useMiniPay.ts` — detects `window.ethereum.isMiniPay`, auto-connects with `injected()`, exposes `{ isMiniPay, address, isConnected }`
- [x] `hooks/useCUSDBalance.ts` — reads cUSD balance via wagmi `useReadContract`, returns formatted string
- [x] `lib/viemClient.ts` — Viem public client on forno.celo.org
- [x] `components/WalletConnect.tsx` — 4 states: MiniPay pill, browser connected pill, wrong network amber button, RainbowKit connect button
- [x] `WalletConnect` wired into home page header and task page header
- [x] WalletConnect project ID set in `.env.local`
- [x] Both routes compile 200 with wallet component ✓

### Day 7 — cUSD balance + network enforcement

- [x] `hooks/useCUSDBalance.ts` — `refetchInterval: 5000` keeps balance live (≈ 1 Celo block)
- [x] cUSD balance shown in WalletConnect pill on all pages
- [x] `components/NetworkGuard.tsx` — full-screen wrong-network blocker with Switch to Celo button
- [x] `NetworkGuard` wired into `providers.tsx` — covers every route automatically
- [x] Celo Mainnet in wagmi config; RainbowKit inherits it

---

## Phase 4 — Payment Integration (Day 8)

### Day 8 — approve() + requestTask() flow

- [x] `lib/contract.ts` — inline ABI fragments for requestTask, TaskRequested event, ERC20 approve/allowance
- [x] `hooks/useTaskPayment.ts` — approve → waitForReceipt → requestTask → waitForReceipt state machine; returns `{ status, txHash, isPending, isConfirmed, error, startPayment, reset }`
- [x] `components/PaymentModal.tsx` — bottom-sheet modal, 6-state UI (idle/approving/approved/paying/confirmed/error), step progress bar, Celoscan tx link, try-again on error
- [x] Pay button in task page wired to modal; disabled when wallet not connected
- [x] Build passes clean (`npm run build` — all 4 routes generated)
